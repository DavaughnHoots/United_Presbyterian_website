Holy, holy, holy! all the saints adore thee,\nCasting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea.\nCherubim and seraphim, falling down before thee,\nWho was and is and evermore shall be.\n\n3. Holy, Holy, Holy! though the darkness hide thee,\nThough the eye of sinful man thy glory may not see,\nOnly thou art holy; there is none beside thee,\nPerfect in pow'r, in love, and purity.\n\n4. Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!\nAll thy works shall praise thy name, in earth, and sky, and sea;\nHoly, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!\nGod in three Persons, blessed Trinity.",
